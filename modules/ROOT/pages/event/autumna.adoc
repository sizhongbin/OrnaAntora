= Paths of Fomoria - House of Autumna
:page-role: -toc

== SzHb’s Notes

=== Goodies

. Summon Buggane
* T8. High damage
* From Arcanist and Monumental Guild
* Good summon for PVE
. T10 Autumna Gears
* 1.2x debuff chance. 2x(3x for Sequana’s) debuff damage on opponents
* From T10 event bosses
* Assassin debuff build for PVP

=== Tips

. Gears from different house have different specific effect:
* Nocturna: Less damage from opponents’ followers/summons.
* Autumna: Better debuff application. More debuff damage on opponents.
* Sumner: More AoE damage. Sometimes single target skills will hit a second target.
* Wintara: Buffs sometimes also apply to party mates. Positive status effects last longer.
. Gears from Crest of Nocturna/Autumna/Sumner/Wintara have all the weakened house effects.

== Event Checklist (mostly from community)

=== Bosses

The following bosses will spawn in world when its rainy (or during scroll of chaos), as well as in Chaos Portal. They can be only damaged by status effect.
