== SzHb’s Notes

=== Goodies

. **★9 Off-hand - Great Phoenician Shield**
* Burn and Blind immune
* From ★9 raid Arisen Phoenix
* For classes without Steadfast
. **★5 Armor adorn - Red Pinion**
* 2% ward (superior+) and overall stat boost
* From ★7/9 raid (Arisen) Phoenix
* Only if you don't have enough JoC
. **★5/9 Weapon adorn - (Ashen) Ruby**
* 50% chance to recover 1%/2% of damage dealt per adorn
* From ★5/9 boss Ascended Pledge / Fallen Ashen Phoenix
* Good for horde

=== Tips

. All gears from event monsters, bosses and raids can be dismantled for silk.
. Phoenixrise Ritual only deals damage to targets marked by the Phoenix’s Pledge. Strikes = Target’s Tier. Total M2 = Strikes × 1.2.
