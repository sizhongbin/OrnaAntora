[quote,The Prose Edda]
____
There is one place that is called Alfheim. There live the folk called light-elves (Ljósálfar), but dark-elves (Dökkálfar) live down in the ground, and they are unlike them in appearance, and even more unlike them in nature. Light-elves are fairer than the sun to look at, but dark-elves are blacker than pitch.
