=== Tips
. Gears from different house have different specific effect.
* Nocturna: Less damage from opponents’ followers/summons.
* Autumna: Better debuff application. More debuff damage on opponents.
* Sumner: More AoE damage. Sometimes single target skills will hit a second target.
* Wintara: Buffs sometimes also apply to party mates. Positive status effects last longer.
. All gears from House of Nocturna/Autumna/Sumner/Wintara event bosses except King Fomor have Nocturna/Autumna/Sumner/Wintara effect.
. All gears from King Fomor in all Paths of Fomoria events have all weakened house effects except a better debuff application.
