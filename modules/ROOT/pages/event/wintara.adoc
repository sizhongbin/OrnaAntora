= Paths of Fomoria - House of Wintara

== SzHb’s Notes

. Gears from different house have different specific effect.
* Nocturna: Less damage from opponents’ followers/summons.
* Autumna: Better debuff application. More debuff damage on opponents.
* Sumner: More AoE damage. Sometimes single target skills will hit a second target.
* Wintara: Buffs sometimes also apply to party mates. Positive status effects last longer.
. All gears from House of Wintara event bosses except the ones summoned by crest have Wintara effect. All gears from Paths of Fomoria event bosses summoned by crest have all weakened house effects.
. Get Summon Buggane if you are summoner (attuner) classline.
. Get the following immune gears if you need. Useable by magic user only.
* *_T4_* / *_T8_* / *_T10_* (Arisen) (Cursed) Lero’s Hood: Frozen
